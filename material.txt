write(2) and send is the same when flag is 0.


we didn't use fwrite() because fwrite  While it can be used with sockets, it adds an additional layer
of buffering that might not be desirable in network programming where you typically want more control 
over when data is actually sent over the network.

/*
received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe," typically occurs when you try to write to a socket 
that has been closed by the other end (in this case, the client). It's a signal that the operating system
sends to your program to indicate that a pipe or socket on which your program is writing has been closed.
*/
there for we use signal:
signal (or sigaction) is a global variable so we can define it once at the begining of the program.
