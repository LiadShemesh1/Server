/*
received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe," typically occurs when you try to write to a socket 
that has been closed by the other end (in this case, the client). It's a signal that the operating system
sends to your program to indicate that a pipe or socket on which your program is writing has been closed.
*/
there for we use signal:
signal (or sigaction) is a global variable so we can define it once at the begining of the program.
